🌿 Overall Design Philosophy
Minimalist Aesthetic: Avoid clutter; prioritize whitespace and clean lines.

Medical Professional Theme: Soft whites, light greys, and medical blues/greens. Gentle shadows and subtle gradients to give depth.

Mobile-First: All views should adapt gracefully to screens < 480px wide.

Accessibility First: Clear contrast, readable font sizes, large touch targets.

✅ UX Best Practices
Avoid long-scroll walls of text — use accordions or tabs.

Sticky buttons at bottom of screen for primary actions.

Use toast notifications (e.g., “Diagnosis Generated Successfully”).

Allow copy-to-clipboard with visual feedback.

Light/Dark mode toggle (optional, if time permits).
