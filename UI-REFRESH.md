# UI Refresh Report

This report summarizes the UI/UX refactoring efforts, focusing on establishing a consistent design system and improving accessibility.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Design System Definition

*   **Centralized Design Tokens:** A new file, `src/lib/design-tokens.ts`, was created to centralize color, font, spacing, border-radius, and shadow definitions. This ensures a single source of truth for design values.
*   **`globals.css` Update:** The `:root` and `.dark` CSS variable definitions in `src/app/globals.css` were updated to reflect the new design tokens, including previously undefined `sidebar` related colors.
*   **`tailwind.config.ts` Update:** The Tailwind configuration was updated to import and utilize the `colors` object from `src/lib/design-tokens.ts`, ensuring that Tailwind classes correctly map to the defined design tokens.

### 2. Component Refactoring (Review)

*   Existing UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Tabs`, `Accordion`, `Select`) were reviewed. They already leverage `cva` and `cn` utilities with CSS variables, aligning well with the new design system. No significant refactoring was required for these components as they already followed a token-driven approach.

### 3. Global CSS Cleanup (Review)

*   `src/app/globals.css` was reviewed. It primarily uses `@tailwind` directives and CSS variables, indicating a clean and maintainable global stylesheet. No unused or conflicting CSS rules were identified beyond what Tailwind provides. The mobile-first approach is inherent in Tailwind's design.

### 4. Theming & Accessibility Improvements

*   **Theme Toggling:** The existing light/dark mode toggling mechanism via `ThemeProvider` and CSS variables was confirmed to be in place.
*   **`Header` Component Accessibility:**
    *   Added `aria-label="Toggle theme"` to the theme toggle button for improved screen reader support.
    *   Added `aria-label="Open navigation menu"` to the mobile navigation trigger button for improved screen reader support.
*   **`Toaster` Component Accessibility:** Confirmed that the `ToastViewport` component from Radix UI provides `aria-live="polite"` regions, ensuring toast notifications are announced by screen readers.
*   **`HistoryCard` Component Accessibility:** Confirmed that `Link` components are used semantically for navigation.
*   **Google Sign-in Button Accessibility:** Added `aria-label="Continue with Google"` to the Google sign-in button in `src/app/login/page.tsx` for better screen reader context.

### 5. Spacing & Layout (Review)

*   The application's layout generally utilizes Tailwind's spacing utilities (`p`, `m`, `gap`), which are based on a consistent scale. No major refactoring was required for spacing or layout, as the existing implementation already promotes consistency and responsiveness.

## New Token Values

All new and updated color token values are defined in `src/lib/design-tokens.ts`. Please refer to that file for the complete list of HSL values for both light and dark modes, including the newly defined sidebar colors.

## Manual QA Steps

Due to the nature of this environment, the following steps could not be automated and require manual verification:

1.  **Visual Consistency:** Verify visual consistency across all screens (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure the new design tokens are applied correctly and there are no unexpected visual regressions.
2.  **Responsive Behavior:** Test the application on various screen sizes and orientations to confirm proper responsive behavior.
3.  **Automated Contrast Checker:** Run an automated contrast checker (e.g., Lighthouse, browser developer tools) to ensure all text-background combinations meet WCAG AA accessibility standards.
4.  **Keyboard Navigation:** Thoroughly test keyboard navigation throughout the application to ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable using only the keyboard.
5.  **Screen Reader Testing:** Test the application with a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to confirm that all content is correctly announced and interactive elements are understandable.

## Before/After Screenshots

Before/after screenshots are not available in this environment. Manual visual inspection is required to assess the visual changes.
